    "page_3": "Patient Name: Maxie, Latoria DOB: 8/9/1976 Diagnostic Test Findings: Electrodiagnostic study images reviewed with the patient. Consistent with evidence of a left lower trunk brachial plexopathy. Evaluation of the median motor nerve as well as the ulnar motor nerve showed no response. The left median sensory radial sensory and ulnar sensory nerves showed no response. Needle evaluation of the first dorsal interossei muscle showed moderately increased spontaneous activity. Left abductor pollicis brevis and left pronator teres and left brachial radialis muscle show slightly increased spontaneous activity. Left triceps muscle showed increased insertional activity. There is no electrodiagnostic evidence of left cervical radiculopathy. Previous X-ray Studies: 3 views the left hand taken today show the IP joints of the digits held in flexion. No acute findings. Diagnosis Codes: M25.642 Stiffness of left hand, not elsewhere classified, G54.0 Brachial plexus disorders, M24.542 Contracture, left hand, G56.22 Lesion of ulnar nerve, left upper limb Impression: Stiffness Joint Left Hand Treatment Plan: She continues to have issues with the hand. She has done therapy for a while now she relief attempted to be patient and and nonoperative treatment and just not making the progress were hoping for. Difficult to get full assessment of the intrinsics and intrinsics because the PIP joints are locked and stiff. We need to proceed in a stepwise fashion. We will cannot release the PIP joints get them fully mobilized we talked about that we would then potentially in a staged fashion bringing the MCP joint into flexion to allow for full extension of the IP joints if necessary. If just releasing the PIP joints get the digits better aligned and functional then we can stop from the first procedure. She voices understanding is ready to proceed. Consent was obtained today. Discussed capsulectomies and tenolysis of all 4 digits index finger middle finger ring finger and small finger. I discussed the possibility of recurrence of progressive stiffness. We discussed aggressive therapy postoperatively helpful in this her overall recovery. A course of occupational therapy was recommended.
